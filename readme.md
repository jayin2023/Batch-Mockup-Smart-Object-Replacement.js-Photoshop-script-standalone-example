# STANDALONE EXAMPLE for Batch Mockup Smart Object Replacement.jsx

## To test this example

1. Check: 
    - `assets/example-mockup.psd` - To understand what to expect from the output files. Might want to open it too
    - `assets/_input files` - To understand what kind of files are input
    - `assets/_output files` - To understand that comes out
2. Remove the folder: `assets/_output files` (or the files inside)
    - This will be created and filled when the settings script (below) is run. The script would overwrite files, but for testing purposes it would be better to remove the folder and see what happens.
3. Open/run `Batch replace example (Run this file in PS).jsx` in Photoshop. 
    - If you don't now how, check [this documentation/gif](https://joonaspaakko.gitbook.io/batch-mockup-smart-object-replacement-jsx-photosho/how-to-run-the-script).
4. Check the folder: `assets/_output files`
    - You may be able to keep the folder open while the script runs to see each output file as they are created. Just make sure the folder window is not overlapping with Photoshop's window.

> You could also try to play with the settings and input files to get a better understanding of its capabilities. The script repository includes more advanced examples.
